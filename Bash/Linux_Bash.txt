# Simple Bash Script 

This is a simple bash script created for the Coursera Data Engineering course. It prints a phrase multiple times with optional reversal.
This script was created to demonstrate basic bash scripting skills, including:

- Using concatenate to combine all repeated output into a single string
-Adding a delimiter character between repeated phrases
- Using a function to convert phrase to uppercase on each repeat
